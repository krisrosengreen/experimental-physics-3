# Experimental Physics III

These Python data analysis files were used to analyse data recorded in experiments devised for the Experimental Physics III course offered by Aarhus University.

# Notice

These files are incomplete due to untimely migration from Gitlab to Github. The code to analyze the data from the experiments were uploaded to a student Gitlab account that was subsequently automatically deleted once I completed my bachelor's degree. For this reason, some files may be outdated, or missing. The repository for analyzing the data obtained for experiment 3 was lost.

Some data files were too large to upload to GitHub, therefore they were excluded.
